The day I met my soulmate

It was an usual Friday evening until I found out that I have left the umbrella in a cornermost lecture room in the last floor. 
I knew for sure that even if I would have a magical power to keep myself not getting wet amidst the heavy rain, there is no way that I could escape from my mother who was anxiously waiting the umbrella to return home.
Blaming Mr. Marcus for not winding up the lecture on time, I started walking along the narrow corridor which leads to the staircase.
I could not hear anything other than my own footsteps.
I was calm and quit until I found out that I was walking slower than the footsteps which I earlier thought to be my own foot steps.

It felt like someone was coming from behind.
After a while, I felt someone tap on my back.
I looked back and no one was there. Ater a short distance, he looked back and saw a beautiful girl.
