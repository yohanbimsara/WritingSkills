It was an usual Friday evening until I found out that I have left the umbrella in a cornermost lecture room in the last floor. 
I knew for sure that even if I would have a magical power to keep myself not getting wet amidst the heavy rain, there is no way that I could escape from my mother who was anxiously waiting the umbrella to return home.
Blaming Mr. Marcus for not winding up the lecture on time, I started walking along the narrow corridor which leads to the staircase.
